### Roles:
1. **Customer**: Represents a retail company looking to reduce the theft of their products while they are placed on shelves.
2. **Product Manager (PM)**: Liaises between the customer and the Individual Contributor (IC), translating business needs into technical requirements.
3. **Individual Contributor (IC)**: A designer, data analyst, scientist or engineer responsible for formulating a solution.

### Task Description:
1. **Introduction Phase**: The customer will present their problem, such as detecting the theft of items in a store's shelves. The PM will facilitate this discussion, making sure to understand the customer's needs and expectations.
   
3. **Planning Phase**: The PM, with insights from the IC, will break down the problem into actionable tasks. This includes defining the scope and timeline, etc. Collaboration between all roles is essential here.

4. **Development Phase**: The IC will develop a conceptual model or a prototype (can be done on paper) that fits the requirements set by the PM and the customer. During this phase, regular meetings should be held to check alignment with the goals.

5. **Presentation Phase**: The PM and IC will present their solution to the entire class (acting as stakeholders). This includes explaining the solution, showcasing how it aligns with the business problem, and how it will be managed throughout the process.
The group also discusses what could be challenges in terms of communication, planning, and execution. Here the group must reflect on all the things that might happen (fail) when executing a real project. 

Note: the group is free to propose a different task that follows a similar framework to tackle a business problem. 

### Materials Needed:
- Whiteboards or paper for sketching models and plans.
- Sample data or mock-up data to represent the products in retail (this can be fictional for the purpose of the task).

### Learning Outcomes:
- Understanding the importance of clear communication between customer, PM, and IC.
- Gaining insights into how to translate business needs into technical requirements.
- Learning about iterative development and how regular check-ins can keep a project on track.
- Recognizing the challenges and responsibilities in product management, especially in the context of scoping and timelines in data science and engineering.
